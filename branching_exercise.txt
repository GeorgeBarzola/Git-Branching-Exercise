1.- What git command creates a branch?

2.- What is the difference between a fast-forward and recursive merge?
fast-forward merge happens when there is no new merge commit created in the original branch.

3.- What git command changes to another branch?
git checkout (the_branch_ name)

4.- What git command deletes a branch?

Merge conflicts usually occur when modifying the same file on different branches. When git finds a merge conflict it marks the conflicted sections in the  affected files with special markers.
